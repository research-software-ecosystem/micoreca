N-Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational mechanisms in eukaryotes. It plays a vital role in various biological processes such as protein folding, stability, immunogenicity of different proteins, cell signaling and protein targeting. N-glycosylation predominantly occurs in N-X-[S T] sequon where X is any amino acid other than proline. However, not all N-X-[S T] sequons in proteins are glycosylated. Therefore, accurate prediction of N-glycosylation sites is essential to understand N-glycosylation mechanism. We developed a random forest method, Nglyc, to predict N-glycosylation sites in eukaryotic protein sequences. The method used 315 features derived from a protein sequence and its sequence homologs.

BACKGROUND:Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification. Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. The limited sensitivity of existing read-based error correction methods can cause large-scale mis-assemblies in the assembled genomes, motivating further innovation in this area. RESULTS:Here we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method, called MiniScrub, for identification and subsequent ""scrubbing"" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments to minimize their interference in downstream assembly process. MiniScrub first generates read-to-read overlaps via MiniMap2, then encodes the overlaps into images, and finally builds CNN models to predict low-quality segments"	False	True	False

There is a very fundamental difference in the use of torsional potential functions as compared to bond length and angle potentials. Only a small subset of the full potential energy domain, around the minumum, is realized in the parabolic-like bond length and angle potentials. Therefore the emphasis in fitting these potentials is to reproduce potential near the minimum, with not so much concern about the functional form, or parameterization, or large excursions from equilibrium because they are energetically disallowed.

DNA-binding proteins play essential roles in many molecular functions and gene regulation. Therefore, it becomes highly desirable to develop effective computational techniques for detecting DNA-binding proteins. In this paper, we proposed a new method, iDBP-DEP, which performs DNA-binding prediction by using the discriminative feature derived from multi-view feature sources including evolutionary profile, dipeptide composition, and physicochemical properties with feature selection. We evaluated iDBP-DEP on two benchmark datasets, i. e., PDB1075 and PDB594 by rigorous Jackknife test. Compared with the state-of-the-art sequence-based DNA-binding predictors, the proposed iDBP-DEP achieved 1.8 % and 3.0 % improvements of accuracy (Acc) and Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC), respectively, on PDB1075 dataset; 7.4 % and 14.8 % improvements of Acc and MCC, respectively, on PDB594"	False	True	False

BACKGROUND:Orthology inference is normally based on full-length protein sequences. However, most proteins contain independently folding and recurring regions, domains. The domain architecture of a protein is vital for its function, and recombination events mean individual domains can have different evolutionary histories. It has previously been shown that orthologous proteins may differ in domain architecture, creating challenges for orthology inference methods operating on full-length sequences. We have developed Domainoid, a new tool aiming to overcome these challenges faced by full-length orthology methods by inferring orthology on the domain level. It employs the InParanoid algorithm on single domains separately, to infer groups of orthologous domains. RESULTS:This domain-oriented approach allows detection of discordant domain orthologs, cases where different domains on the same protein have different evolutionary histories"	False	True	False

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the leading causes of permanent blindness in the working-age population. Automatic grading of DR and DME helps ophthalmologists design tailored treatments to patients, thus is of vital importance in the clinical practice. However, prior works either grade DR or DME, and ignore the correlation between DR and its complication, i.e., DME. Moreover, the location information, e.g., macula and soft hard exhaust annotations, are widely used as a prior for grading. Such annotations are costly to obtain, hence it is desirable to develop automatic grading methods with only image-level supervision.

Abstract Motivation Identifying the genes regulated by a given transcription factor (its “target genes”) is a key step in developing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Previously we developed a method for predicting the target genes of a transcription factor (TF) based solely on the correlation between a histone modification at the TF’s binding site and the expression of the gene across a set of tissues. That approach is limited to organisms for which extensive histone and expression data is available, and does not explicitly incorporate the genomic distance between the TF and the gene. Results We present the T-Gene algorithm, which overcomes these limitations. T-Gene can be used to predict which genes are most likely to be regulated by a TF, and which of the TF’s binding sites are most likely involved in regulating particular genes."	False	True	False

Exposome is the future of next-generation environmental health to establish the association between environmental exposure and diseases. However, due to low concentrations of exposure chemicals, exposome has been hampered by lacking an effective analytical platform to characterize its composition. In this study, by combining the benefit of chemical isotope labeling and pseudo-multiple reaction monitoring (CIL-pseudo-MRM), we have developed one highly sensitive and high-throughput platform (CIL-ExPMRM) by isotope labeling urinary exposure biomarkers. Dansyl chloride (DnsCl), <i>N< i>-methylphenylethylamine (MPEA), and their isotope-labeled forms were used to derivatize polar hydroxyl and carboxyl compounds, respectively

r-rocr		biocontainers_description	ITS in BioContainers description	True			ROC graphs, sensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts, and precision/recall plots are popular examples of trade-off visualizations for specific pairs of performance measures. ROCR is a flexible tool for creating cutoff-parameterized 2D performance curves by freely combining two from over 25 performance measures (new performance measures can be added using a standard interface). Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only three commands and reasonable default values for all optional parameters.	True	False	False

This allows to deduce the real spoligotype, to detect mutants of spacers and direct repeats, insertion of mobile elements, and duplications. The Cas locus is reconstructed too. This is a semi automatic approach that leads to a set of contigs to assemble manually. Depending on the number, length, and quality of SRAs, the number of contigs can range from 1-2 patterns, in the best case scenario where the good quality of sequences allows a quasi-automatic reconstruction of the CRISPR cut in mobile element positions, to several contigs difficult to process, for too short or polluted reads.

Sequencing is widely used, and generates very large amounts of data, mainly due to reduced cost and advanced technologies. Quickly assessing the quality of giga-to-tera base levels of sequencing data has become a routine but important task. Identification and elimination of low-quality sequence data is crucial for reliability of downstream analysis results. There is a need for a high-speed tool that uses optimized parallel programming for batch processing and simply gauges the quality of sequencing data from multiple datasets independent of any other processing steps.

SUMMARY:Open source software such as ImageJ and CellProfiler greatly simplified the quantitative analysis of microscopy images but their applicability is limited by the size, dimensionality and complexity of the images under study.

Previously, we had trained an ensemble machine learning model to assign a probability of having synaptic function to every protein-coding gene in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach resulted in the publication of a catalogue of 893 genes which we postulated to be very enriched in genes with a still undocumented synaptic function. Since then, the scientific community has experimentally identified 79 new synaptic genes. Here we use these new empirical data to evaluate our original prediction. We also implement a series of changes to the training scheme of our model and using the new data we demonstrate that this improves its predictive power"	False	True	False

Abstract High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalising syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterise taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth CS) to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from the survey metadata."

However, rather few methods are sensitive to topologic-geometric features, the examples being knots, slipknots, lassos, links, and pokes, and with each method aimed only for a specific set of such configurations. We here propose a general method which transforms a structure into a “fingerprint of topological-geometric values” consisting in a series of real-valued descriptors from mathematical Knot Theory. The extent to which a structure contains unusual configurations can then be judged from this fingerprint. The method is therefore not confined to a particular pre-defined topology or geometry (like a knot or a poke), and so, unlike existing methods, it is general	False	True	False

Nowadays its widely accepted that cellular processes spanning from gene expression to protein synthesis can be regulated by dietary compounds.

Abstract Motivation Fungi are key elements in several important ecological functions, ranging from organic matter decomposition to symbiotic associations with plants. Moreover, fungi naturally inhabit the human microbiome and can be causative agents of human infections. An accurate and robust method for fungal ITS classification is not only desired for the purpose of better diversity estimation, but it can also help us gain a deeper insight of the dynamics of environmental communities and ultimately comprehend whether the abundance of certain species correlate with health and disease. Although many methods have been proposed for taxonomic classification, to the best of our knowledge, none of them consider the taxonomic tree hierarchy when building their models.

The problem of unknown network width is alleviated by efficient integration of convolution kernel with different receptive fields. In addition, the multi-scale block is extended to other variants of the original U-Net to verify its universality. Five different medical image segmentation datasets are used to evaluate MSU-Net.

Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions"	False	True	False

r-mixomics		biocontainers_description	metagenomics in BioContainers description	True			Multivariate methods are well suited to large omics data sets where the number of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). They have the appealing properties of reducing the dimension of the data by using instrumental variables (components), which are defined as combinations of all variables. Those components are then used to produce useful graphical outputs that enable better understanding of the relationships and correlation structures between the different data sets that are integrated. mixOmics offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection. The package proposes several sparse multivariate models we have developed to identify the key variables that are highly correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome of interest. The data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high throughput sequencing technologies, such as omics data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics etc) but also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging). The methods implemented in mixOmics can also handle missing values without having to delete entire rows with missing data. A non exhaustive list of methods include variants of generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares and sparse Discriminant Analysis. Recently we implemented integrative methods to combine multiple data sets: N-integration with variants of Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis and P-integration with variants of multi-group Partial Least Squares.

As the videos captured by hand-held cameras are often perturbed by high-frequency jitters, stabilization of these videos is an essential task. Many video stabilization methods have been proposed to stabilize shaky videos. However, most methods estimate one global homography or several homographies based on fixed meshes to warp the shaky frames into their stabilized views. Due to the existence of parallax, such single or a few homographies can not well handle the depth variation. In contrast to these traditional methods, we propose a novel video stabilization network, called PWStableNet, which comes up pixel-wise warping maps, i.e., potentially different warping for different pixels, and stabilizes each pixel to its stabilized view.

Haplotyping reveals chromosome blocks inherited from parents to in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), enabling the observation of the transmission of disease alleles between generations. However, the methods of haplotyping that are suitable for single cells are limited because a whole genome amplification (WGA) process is performed before sequencing or genotyping in PGD, and true haplotype profiles of embryos need to be constructed based on genotypes that can contain many WGA artifacts. RESULTS:Here, we offer scHaplotyper as a genetic diagnosis tool that reconstructs and visualizes the haplotype profiles of single cells based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). scHaplotyper can trace the origin of each haplotype block in the embryo, enabling the detection of carrier status of disease alleles in each embryo."

d-script	d-script	biotools_description	ITS in bio.tools description	True	Protein interaction network prediction, Protein interaction prediction, Residue contact prediction	Molecular modelling, Protein interactions, Small molecules	D-SCRIPT is a deep learning method for predicting a physical interaction between two proteins given just their sequences. It generalizes well to new species and is robust to limitations in training data size. Its design reflects the intuition that for two proteins to physically interact, a subset of amino acids from each protein should be in con-tact with the other. The intermediate stages of D-SCRIPT directly implement this intuition, with the penultimate stage in D-SCRIPT being a rough estimate of the inter-protein contact map of the protein dimer. This structurally-motivated design enhances the interpretability of the results and, since structure is more conserved evolutionarily than sequence, improves generalizability across species.
