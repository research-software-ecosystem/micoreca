(dimedr) attempts to bridge the inconsistencies between incongruent lc-ms metabolomics datasets of the same biological sample type. a single “primary” dataset is postprocessed via traditional means of peak identification, alignment, and grouping. dimedr utilizes this primary dataset as a progenitor template by which data from subsequent disparate datasets are reassembled and integrated into a unified framework that maximizes spectral feature similarity across all samples. this is accomplished by a novel procedure for universal retention time correction and comparison via identification of ubiquitous features in the initial primary dataset, which are subsequently utilized as endogenous internal standards during integration.

pwgbssimla	biotools_description	profile-based whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data simulator incorporating methylation qtls, allele-specific methylations and differentially methylated regions | motivation:dna methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression. dna methylation is commonly analyzed using bisulfite sequencing (bs-seq)-based designs, such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (wgbs), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (rrbs), and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxbs-seq). furthermore, there has been growing interest in investigating the roles that genetic variants play in changing the methylation levels (i.e., methylation quantitative trait loci or meqtls), how methylation regulates the imprinting of gene expression (i.e., allele-specific methylation or asm), and the differentially methylated regions (dmrs) among different cell types

epigenetic-target-profiler	biotools_description	profiler is a web server to predict epigenetic targets of small molecules. the identification of protein targets of small molecules is essential for drug discovery. with the increasing amount of chemogenomic data in the public domain, multiple ligand-based models for target prediction have emerged. however, these models are generally biased by the number of known ligands for different targets, which involves an under-representation of epigenetic targets, and despite the increasing importance of epigenetic targets in drug discovery, there are no open tools for epigenetic target prediction. in this work, we introduce epigenetic target profiler (etp), a freely accessible and easy-to-use web application for the prediction of epigenetic targets of small molecules. for a query compound, etp predicts its bioactivity profile over a panel of 55 different epigenetic targets
